#	Resnet Architecture Variation Comparison on CIFAR-10 Dataset

This report presents experiments on using deep residual networks (ResNets) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. We investigated the performance of ResNet-18, ResNet-34, and ResNet-50 architectures in combination with adaptive max or average pooling and SGD or Adam optimizers. The models were trained for 10 epochs and evaluated on classification accuracy. The best performing model achieved 75.68\% test accuracy using a ResNet-34 with adaptive average pooling and SGD optimization. In general, ResNet-34 and ResNet-18 outperformed ResNet-50, adaptive average pooling was superior to adaptive max pooling, and SGD optimization greatly outperformed Adam. The results demonstrate the power of residual learning for image classification and the importance of proper model configuration. Furthermore, we analyze the training dynamics, computational requirements, and generalization capabilities of the models, providing insights for practitioners and researchers working on similar image classification tasks.
